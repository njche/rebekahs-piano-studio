                    Hello! My name is Rebekah Marvin and I am a pianist, teacher and composer located in Grand Rapids, MI. I have been playing piano since age 4, and my love for music – teaching, performing, and composing – has only grown in the decades since. I graduated from Grand Valley State University in 2021, receiving a BA in music and focusing on piano performance and music composition. My piano teachers have included Tiffany Shomsky, Darla Proseus, and Dr. Sookkyung Cho, while my composition teachers were Alexander Miller and Dr. Bill Ryan. I enjoy performing in a variety of settings, including church, weddings, accompanying soloists, and more. One performance highlight was joining the GVSU New Music Ensemble during the summer of 2022 on a tour of five national parks in the western United States, premiering a set of all-new works inspired by the parks.

                    I have 4 years of experience teaching piano to students of all ages. While I focused mainly on piano performance when I was in school, I have found teaching to be a passion of mine in recent years; as a mother, it is a way I can continue to make an impact in the community around me, while balancing a busy life with small children. I also continue to write music and perform. I have released a few recordings on YouTube and an album of my compositions is in the works.

                    In my spare time I enjoy reading, knitting, sewing, organizing my house, and spending time with my husband and daughter.
