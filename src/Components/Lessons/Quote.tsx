                        I would teach children music, physics, and philosophy;

                        <h3>Teaching Philosophy: Student-Led, Teacher-Directed</h3>
                        While I use lesson books to provide structure (see below), I also encourage students to be curious and ask questions. Sometimes this means lessons go in a different direction than I had planned, but that’s okay! We have fun during lessons, playing games and finding new, interesting music to work on. Beginners start with basic piano technique and music reading skills, then progress into working on classical music.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If I could sum up my goal as a teacher in one sentence, it would be this: My hope is that all of my students, regardless of age, ability, or how long they study with me, will remain friends with the piano long after they leave my studio.

                        <h3>Teaching Methods</h3>
                        I love connecting with students of all ages, 3 years old to adults. I use a variety of methods depending on the age and ability of the student:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For students 3-6 years old, I use the <a href="https://www.irinagorin.com/collections/tales-of-a-musical-journey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of a Musical Journey</a> method, which is geared specifically towards small children. This fun series uses stories and games so that small children learn without knowing it. While I of course accept students of any age (it’s never too late to start, as I always tell my adult students!), I encourage parents of young children to consider starting them as early as 3 years old. Three to six years old is the prime age to start your child’s piano lessons – they will never again be able to learn as quickly or retain as much information as during this critical period.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For students around age 7 and up, I use the popular <a href="https://pianoadventures.com/piano-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piano Adventures</a> series, which has a few different editions for young kids, older kids/teens, and adults. We also learn scales, chord reading, and basic music theory.
