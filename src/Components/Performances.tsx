                            I started playing in church at the age of 9, and have been performing in front of audiences regularly ever since then. I took second place in the 2017 Youth Arts Coalition competition. In 2019, I took second place in the Grand Rapids Youth Symphony’s Piano Concerto Competition, playing the third movement of Clara Schumann’s piano concerto. In the summer of 2022, I went on tour with GVSU’s New Music Ensemble; I also appear in one of their music videos 
                            (Punch Brothers • Julep • and US!).

                            From church worship teams, to solo recitals, to accompanying soloists on other instruments, to playing for weddings… I’ve always loved sharing the joy of music with others.
